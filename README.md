# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
This project is part of the IBM data science professional certificate and is intended to demonstrate my foundational Python skills for working with data. 
This course primarily involves completing a project in which I assumed the role of a Data Scientist or a Data Analyst and was provided with a real-world data set and a real-world inspired scenario to identify patterns and trends. I performed specific data science and analytics tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard. 
This project is to showcase my proficiency with Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup within a Jupyter Notebook.
